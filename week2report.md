# part 3
  
  In a couple of sentences, describe something you learned from lab in week 2 or 3 that you didnâ€™t know before.
  > there were alot of new concepts that I was introduced to in Lab 2 and 3 that I didn't know before. I didn't know how to host servers locally/remotely, and now I have somewhat grasped the basics of pushing files onto a remote system and running the server and accessing it through a web browser. Furthermore, I didn't know how to design code to break down the URL in my webbrowser, which I learned last week in lab 2. Moreover, I enriched my debugging knowledge in lab 3.
